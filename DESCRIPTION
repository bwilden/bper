Description: This package provides functions for predicting an individual’s 
    race/ethnicity given their first name, last name, geolocation, 
    political party, age, gender, and address characteristics. 
    The method is based on a Naive Bayes classification algorithm 
    which incorporates known ethnorace distributions over the observed 
    characteristics to generate posterior probabilities for each individual.
