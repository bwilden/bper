Description: This package provides functions for predicting individuals' 
    race/ethnicity given their first name, last name, geo-location, 
    political party, age, gender, and address characteristics. 
    The method is based on a Naive Bayes classification algorithm which 
    incorporates known ethnorace distributions over the previously-mentioned 
    characteristics to produce posterior probabilities for each category.
